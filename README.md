# Overview

This is a web application that students can use to evaluate courses and find courses that meet their expectations. Each review is categorized by its school, department, course, and professor. If any of these categories are not listed, the user can add them to the database in order to complete their course review.

Each course review is anonymous and can be deleted at any time if the user made the review while signed in. Users can also upvote or downvote other reviews anonymously.

This web application only allows validated post-secondary students to register which is done through verifying emails from a set of whitelisted domains and a confirmation email.
